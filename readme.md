# Keyboard seizure

Initially created for Touhou gameplay for funny content reasons.

### Usage

Only playtested on windows, but might work on multi platform.

1. Compile it yourself using `cargo`. If you can't, skill issue.
2. Run the application in a terminal.
3. Press enter at any time (with any window focussed). This will enable the seizure movement. Pressing enter again will stop it. This is to make it easier to navigate menus.
4. Use `ctrl+c` to shut it down once you are done.
